# Media-Viewer 

**Media-Viewer** is a program for managing videos and images in various formats. The program provides a simple way to organize media files locally without relying on complex folder structures. It includes a tag-based search engine, allowing users to quickly locate files.

## Features

## Motivation 
After years of saving images and videos, I wanted a way to organize my files efficiently without relying on online services. Traditional picture viewers made it difficult to handle different formats and maintain an overview of my collection. Media-Viewer was built to solve these issues by offering an offline, tag-based solution that provides the benefits of modern media hosting platforms.

- **Thymeleaf**: Dynamic HTML template engine.
- **Spring**: Handles REST requests and JSON.
- **MySQL**: Relational database system used for storing tags and file names.
- **JDBC**: Java-to-database connector.
